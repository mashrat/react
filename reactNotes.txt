react is a just librery in javascript

CDN Link search for react
react libery is hoisted in CDN

What  is CDN => content delivery network

Why we use CDN
what is crossorigin?


write React in console 
this is rect we have injected in our code

write ReactDOM in console 
this is rect we have injected in our code

There are two file
1) <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
2) <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

->first file is core file for react

->second file this is react library which is use full for DOM operations or this is react DOM which we need modified DOM document object model

Thats why we injected this two file

why we use two file:
react does not work only browser react also work on mobile phn ,like react native,react 3D diffrent type places we are use react

first file is core file and second file is like a bridge for connect DOM,

Chapter 4
